# Tracing changed features for the documentatin with docit

## Current state
docit is currently not production ready by far. Sorry for that. At the moment it just serves as prrof of concept approach for one aspect of the bigger problem.

## Prerequisites for testing

* checkout https://github.com/gabrielfalcao/lettuce
* checkout docit

## Testing

1. git difftool -y --extcmd /{PathTo}/docit/docitdiff.py 0.2.5 0.2.7  >> out.html
2. have a look at out.html
3. remove out.html
4. GOTO 1 and try other tags

## What for this crap

### Background

### Solved problem

### Future work
